### Benchmarking ðŸ“‚
Both unconstrained and constrained optimisation problems based on mathematical functions and chemical engineering case studies such as PID tuning are treated. The benchmarking procedure compares state-of-the-art DDO algorithms.

### Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OptiMaL-PSE-Lab/DDO-4-ChemEng.git
git cd your-repo
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

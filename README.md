Welcome to the DDO-4-ChemEng repository! 🎉

This repository is a work-in-progress (WIP) project running in parallel with the book chapter titled "Data-driven optimization for chemical processes: machine learning and artificial intelligence" 📚

## Sections 📂

### 01_unconstrained
This section contains algorithm benchmarking for unconstrained optimization problems 📈

### 02_constrained
Here, you'll find algorithm benchmarking for constrained optimization problems 🔐

### 03_application (To be continued)
This section will focus on the application of optimization algorithms in a chemical engineering setting (WIP) ⚙️

## About ℹ️

This repository serves as a hub for exploring data-driven optimization algorithms tailored for chemical engineering applications. The goal is to leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize chemical processes efficiently. 🚀
